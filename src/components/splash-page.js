        <h3>What is the X Effect?</h3>
        <p>
          Inspired by a reddit post, the x effect is a way to turn those pesky
          things you always hope you could turn into a habit will finally make
          that transition into something you can do effortlessly. The idea of
          the x effect is that you make an index card with one goal and form a
          7 by 7 grid on. Then every day you complete that goal you put a red
          x on the cell that corresponds to the day. The idea is that once you
          can complete an entire index card with no holes where there should
          be Xâ€™s than you will have that goal be a habit that hoepfully will
          stick with you.
